        Essential Oils
      </h1>

      <p >
                
        Essential oils are natural volatile aromatic compounds found in seeds, bark, stems, roots, flowers,
        and other parts of plants, are responsible for protecting them and play an important role in pollination.
      </p >
      <p >
        If you've ever enjoyed the scent of a rose, then you've experienced the aromatic qualities of essential oils 
        that in addition to providing delicious fragrances have intrinsic benefits that have long been used in food 
        preparation, beauty treatments, and alternative practices for welfare.
        
      </p>
      <h2>
        Essential Oils Aren't a New Trend
      </h2>
      <p>
        Do you feel like you've started to hear a lot about essential oils in the last few years? 
      </p>
      <p>
        While you might think essential oils are a new, hip trend, plant extracts and plant-based products are deeply rooted in the
        traditions of the past. Essential oils have been used by ancient civilizations across the globe for:

      <ul >
        <li>Aromatherapy</li>
        <li>Personal care</li>
        <li>Healthcare practices</li>
        <li>Religious ceremonies</li>
        <li>Beauty treatments</li>
        <li>Food preparation</li>
              
      </ul>
      <h2> How Do Essential Oils Work?</h2>
      <p>
        When you open a bottle of pure, unadulterated essential oil, your senses are 
        instantly filled with its potent aroma, even from a distance. What your nose 
        detects are the naturally occurring elements of the essential oil.
      </p>
      <p>
        Every essential oil varies in its natural makeup, so aromas and benefits are 
        also unique. For example, Lavender oil includes elements that make it effective 
        for soothing skin irritations, reducing anxiousness and feelings of tension, and 
        promoting a restful environment for sleep.
      </p>
      <p>
        Meanwhile, when taken internally, Frankincense oil supports immune, nervous, and 
        digestive systems, and aids in healthy cellular function.
      </p>

      <h2> Use Essential Oils to Transform Your Life </h2>
      <p>
        So many of the products we use in our day-to-day lives are filled with synthetic chemicals.
        These unnatural products can weigh us down and even negatively influence the way we think, feel, and live.
      </p>
      <p>
        Pure essential oils offer an alternative to synthetic products. Essential oils are more than just natural products. 
        Each with a unique chemical makeup, essential oils have dozens of benefits for the body and mind. 
        Essential oil benefits are determined by the chemistry of the plants. If these natural chemicals are 
        properly extracted, they can be used to help you physically, mentally, and emotionally in your daily life.
